		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<h3>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</h3>
		<br>
		<h2>Welcome:</h2>
		A brief one line introduction that states my role as a Front End designer and developer.<br>
		This message will be overlaid on a background to be determined.
	<br>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		This section will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional highlights.<br>
		This section will showcase my strengths and personality. I will feature a contrasting sidebar<br>
		that lists my core skills and programming languages which will be easily readable at a glance.<br>
		The tone of voice will be personable and casual, as I am only interested in opportunities with<br>
		individuals and organizations that I am a good personality fit for.
		<br>
		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		I want this to be an animated, responsive image gallery containing 4-6 examples of my best work.<br>
		Gallery pop-up will include my role and contributions to each project, with iconography to represent the technology used.<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Contact</h2>
		This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address, <br>
		and additional links to my professional social media profiles:<br>
		LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble. (These will also be linked to in the footer site wide via icons.)
