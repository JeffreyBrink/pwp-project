		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<h3>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</h3>
		<br>
		<h2>Welcome:</h2>
		A brief one line introduction that states my role as a Front End designer and developer.<br>
		This message will be overlaid on a gradient background to be determined.
	<br>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		This section will detail my core skill set, and professional highlights.<br>
		This section will showcase my abilities. I will feature my individual software skills<br>
		in an overlay of some of my portfolio images.<br>
		The tone will be attractive yet unobtrusive, as to attract the type of<br>
		individuals and organizations that would appreciate such nuance.
		<br>
		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		I want this to be a responsive image gallery containing 4-6 examples of my best work.<br>
		Gallery pop-up will include my role and contributions to each project, with iconography to represent the technology used.<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Contact</h2>
		<p>
			This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address, <br>
		and additional links to my professional social media profiles:<br>
			LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub. (These will also be linked to in the footer site wide via icons.)
		</p>
