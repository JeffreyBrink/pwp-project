		<p style="color:wheat;font-size:25px"> Ralph is 27 years old.  He is the managing partner of a startup looking<br>
															to hire people to fill key positions within his organization.<br>
															He is debating whether he should hire a separate front-end designer and developer,<br>
															or try and find one person that can handle both jobs.<br>
															He has seen people in the past get hired as both designer and developer,<br>
															yet struggle to do both jobs well at the same time.
			<br>
			<br>Ralph’s organization uses windows 10 machines.<br>
			Ralph was an excellent designer and coder when he was younger,<br>
			but now codes very little in his management role.<br>
			Ralph’s company uses many different programs to design a website,<br>
			but mainly rely on Adobe products (Photoshop, Dreamweaver etc.)
			<br>
			<br>
			When Ralph visits my site, he will find it easy to navagate and well designed.<br>
			It will be effortless for him to see my work and decide I am the right fit for the job.
